          <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
          <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary, and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, such as:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>With your consent.</li>
              <li>To comply with laws.</li>
              <li>To provide you with services.</li>
              <li>To fulfill our contractual obligations.</li>
              <li>To protect your rights.</li>
              <li>To fulfill our legitimate business interests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
          <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. <a href="#withdraw-consent">Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</a></li>
              <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users.</li>
              <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency.</li>
                      <li>Exercise or defend our legal rights.</li>
                      <li>Disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
          <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
          <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way.</li>
              <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention.</li>
              <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met.</li>
              <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim.</li>
              <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.</li>
              <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be a victim of financial abuse.</li>
              <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information, and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province.</li>
              <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records.</li>
              <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession, and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced.</li>
              <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.</li>
              <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.</li>

          <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.</p>
          <p>At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
          <p><strong>California Law Compliance:</strong> California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
